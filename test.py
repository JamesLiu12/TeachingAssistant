Does keeping large animals in aquariums
and zoos foster social benefits like education
and conservation, or is it unethical, sending
the wrong message to young minds? Read
what two people have to say about both sides
of the issue.
Suzanne Gendron is Executive Director of Zoological Operations and Education at Ocean Park,
Hong Kong.
1 [1] Zoos, aquariums and marine parks have
been widely and rightly recognised by the
public and by governments for their longstanding contributions to marine education and
protection of ocean wildlife and habitats.
Worldwide, good zoos and aquariums host over
600 million visitors each year, and in Hong
Kong alone, close to 5 million people visit
Ocean Park annually. For all these people, zoos
and aquariums are a resource for wildlife
education, motivators for environmental
stewardship and a place for family recreation.

[4] A recent study by Dr Lance Miller, a
behavioural biologist with the San Diego Zoo,
demonstrated an increase in conservationrelated knowledge, attitudes and behavioural
intentions immediately after guests viewed a
dolphin show. Three months later, in the next
round of interviews, these guests reported that
they were engaging in more conservationrelated behaviour since their dolphin show
experience. They also retained what they had
learned. These findings echo those of a study
conducted at Ocean Park about our dolphin
interactive programme where, three months
after their participation, guests’ positive
attitudes towards the environment were still
stronger than before the programme.
[2] At Ocean Park Academy, over 35,000
schoolchildren participate each year in our
courses. They include children with special
financial needs and children from schools in
remote areas. Guests can also participate in our
animal encounter programme, which gives them
a chance to see some of Asia’s rarest animals.
Even our restaurants display information panels
which advocate wise seafood choices in support
of sustainable agricultural and fisheries
practices.
[5] Most Hong Kong families live in urban
settings, increasingly withdrawn into an
electronic world of computer downloads,
satellite media and video games. Children are
losing touch with nature and the animal world.
In a time of environmental challenges, zoos and
aquariums are vital links to nature and wildlife.
They connect real-life people and real-life
animals, and foster the understanding that it is
more important, now than ever before, to
conserve our natural environment.
[3] Polls and studies confirm that seeing living,
breathing animals in zoological facilities
inspires children and adults to care about
protecting marine mammals and their declining
ocean environments. A poll taken in 2005
found that the public was nearly unanimous in
its acclaim for the educational impact of marine
life parks, zoos and aquariums. Many
respondents agreed that the experience of seeing
animals in zoos could not be replicated by film
or television.
[6] Saving the planet’s biodiversity is
increasingly more challenging. It is through
good zoos and aquariums that children, families
and communities can meet nature’s
ambassadors. Through these connections, they
will help save the wild places and wild animals
so that future generations will appreciate the
thrill of nature.

[11] But if we are pointing the finger at Sea
World, we should also look more broadly at the
way we confine performing animals. In most
zoos, visitors see bored animals pacing back and
forth in cages, with nothing to do but wait for
the next meal.
[7] In February 2010, at the Sea World
amusement park in Florida, USA, a whale
grabbed a trainer, Dawn Brancheau, pulled her
underwater and thrashed about with her. By the
time rescuers arrived, Brancheau was dead. The
death of the trainer is a tragedy, and one can
only have sympathy for her family. But the
incident raises broader questions: was the attack
deliberate? Did the whale, nicknamed Tilly, act
out of stress at being held captive in a sterile
concrete tank? Was he tired of being forced to
perform to amuse the crowds? Is it right to keep
such large animals in close confinement?

[12] Circuses are even worse places for animals.
Their living conditions are deplorable, especially
in travelling circuses where cages have to be
small so that they can go on the road. Training
animals to perform tricks often involves
starvation and cruelty. Undercover
investigations have repeatedly shown animals
[8] Tilly had been involved in two previous being beaten and given electric shocks.
human deaths. In one episode, a trainer fell
into the pool and Tilly and two other whales
drowned him. In another, a man who appears
to have entered the aquarium at night, when
Sea World was closed, was found dead in the
pool with Tilly. An autopsy showed he had a
bite mark. One of Tilly’s offspring, sold to an
amusement park in Europe, has also killed a
trainer, as have whales in other parks.
[13] Attempts to defend amusement parks and
circuses on the grounds that they ‘educate’
people about animals should not be taken
seriously. Such enterprises are part of the
entertainment industry. The most important
lesson they teach impressionable young minds is
that it is acceptable to keep animals in captivity
for human amusement. That is the opposite of
the ethical attitude that we should be seeking to
[9] Richard Ellis, a marine conservationist at teach children.
the American Museum of Natural History,
believes orcas (a particular species of whales)
are smart and would not do such a thing purely
on impulse. ‘This was premeditated,’ he said.
We will never know exactly what was going on
in Tilly’s mind, but we do know that he has
been in captivity since he was about two years
old. Orcas are social mammals, and he would
have been living with his mother and other
relatives in a group. The sudden separation
was probably traumatic for Tilly.
[14] There is no excuse for keeping wild animals
in amusement parks or circuses. Until our
governments take action, we should avoid
supporting places where captive wild animals
perform for our amusement. If the public will
not pay to see them, the businesses that profit
from keeping animals captive will not be able to
continue.
[10] Moreover, the degree of confinement in
aquariums is extreme, for no tank, no matter
how large, can come close to meeting the needs
of animals who spend their lives in social
groups swimming long distances in the ocean.
Joyce Tischler, of the Animal Legal Defence
Fund, described keeping a six-tonne whale in
Sea World’s tanks as akin to keeping a human
in a bathtub for his entire life.
